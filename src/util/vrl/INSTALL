INSTALL
vred development team
Installation procedure

Simply type './configure' and 'make' in this very directory
(you must use GNU make). This will create 'glui/libglui.a'
(a patched version of GLUI), the main binary 'vred' and the
report 'report-vred.ps'.

To clean the whole tree, type 'make clean'.

Note on GLUI:
The included version of glui is a patched glui v2.0beta. If you want
to use a newer version, you will have to apply the patch available in
the 'glui-patch' directory on it (refer to the corresponding 'INSTALL'
for details).
