Welcome to the GLUI User Interface Library, v2.0 beta!
-------------------------------------------------

This distribution contains the full GLUI sources, as well as 5 example
programs.  You'll find the full manual under "glui_manual.pdf".  The
GLUI web page is at 

	http://www.cs.unc.edu/~rademach/glui


		    ---------- Windows ----------

Precompiled executables are found in 'msvc\bin'

A precompiled library is in 'msvc\lib\glui32.lib'

The directory 'msvc' contains a Visual C++ workspace entitled
'glui.dsw'.  To recompile the library and examples, open this
workspace and run the menu command "Build:Batch Build:Build".  The 3
executables will be in the 'bin' directory, and the library in the
'lib' directory.

To create a new Windows executable using GLUI, create a "Win32 Console
Application" in VC++, add the GLUI library (in 'msvc/lib/glui32.lib'),
and add the OpenGL libs:

	glui32.lib glut32.lib glu32.lib opengl32.lib   (Microsoft OpenGL)

Include the file "glui.h" in any file that uses the GLUI library.


		      ---------- Unix ----------

3 precompiled SGI executables are included: 'example1', 'example2',
'example3' (I've tested them on several local SGIs.  They do not work
on Valine [they crash the X server]).

An SGI/HP makefile is found in the file 'makefile' (to use on HP,
certain lines need to be commented/uncommented).

To include GLUI in your own apps, add the glui library to your
makefile (before the glut library 'libglut.a'), and include "glui.h"
in your sources.

Please let me know what you think, what you'd like to change or add,
and especially what bugs you encounter.  Also, please send me your
e-mail so I can add you to a mailing list for updates.

Good luck, and thanks for trying this out!
