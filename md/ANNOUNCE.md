Hello everybody,


I am pleased to announce the new release 8.2.0 of VREng.
VREng (Virtual Reality Engine), currently developed at Telecom-ParisTech(FR),
is a Distributed 3D Application allowing navigation in virtual
worlds connected over the Internet.

This release is uncompatible with old stable releases
(1.5.8, 1.6.3, 2.5.9, 2.6.5, 3.4.0, 4.3.1, 6.9.3, 7.0.0),
so you are invited to upgrade.

VREng is free under GPL license. To download, fetch:

Any suggestions, comments and bug reports will be welcome,
but without any guarantee of answers depending on my workload.

I apologize if you receive multiple copies of this announce.
