WHAT IS VRENG ?
---------------
VREng (Virtual Reality Engine) is an interactive and distributed 3D application
allowing interactions in real-time between avatars and objects and navigation
in virtual worlds connected over the Internet.


REQUIREMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
--------------------------------
You need the X-Window System (Xorg, X11R6 or Openwin).
Your visual must have a color depth of 8, 15, 16 or 24.

The following libraries are required: libjpeg, libungif, libXpm.
Other recommended libraries: libmysqlclient, libz, libpng.

Your machine and your network should support IP Multicast, mainly IGMPv2
and Multicast routing protocols to see other avatars in the same scene.
If is not the case a Unicast/Multicast Reflector is activated when vreng
is launched. VREng detects automatically if your host is on the MBone,
if true, VREng switches in Multicast mode, else continues in Unicast mode
with the Reflector.


SUPPORTED PLATFORMS
-------------------
	- Linux-*
	- MacOSX-10.*
	- Solaris*
	- Sunos4.1.*
	- HP-UX-B.10.20
	- FreeBsd[345].*
	- NetBsd*
	- CygWin32

VREng has not been ported on other platforms yet, but any port will be welcome.


DOWNLOADING
-----------
The VREng sources are available by:
  - Tarball:    wget http://www.infres.enst.fr/ftp/pub/vreng/vreng.tar.{gz,xz,bz2,zip}
  - Git:        git clone https://github.com/philippedax/vreng.git
  - Subversion: svn co http://www.infres.enst.fr/svn/vreng/trunk vreng


COMPILING
---------

If the script "configure" is not present, you need to build it first by:
	./autogen.sh

VREng uses an OpenGL library. The configure script will usually figure out
which one is installed on your system. There are basically two possibilities:
  1 - Your system already has a vendor OpenGL library installed.
  2 - If you want to use the Mesa free OpenGL emulation library (http://www.mesa3d.org/).

If your OpenGL library is not visible through the standard paths, you
can use the configure option: --with-GL-prefix=DIR.

VREng works with the Ubit toolkit.
Since vreng-7.0.0 the Ubit Toolkit is built in VReng by default.

Before compiling VREng check available features with:
	./configure --help

To compile VREng with defaults, type:
	./configure

and then
	make or gmake


INSTALLING
----------
The vreng binary executable and the vre script-shell
will be installed by default in /usr/local/bin.
To do this, type:
	make install
or
	make install-strip


HOW TO NAVIGATE ?
-----------------
You can alternatively use left button's mouse either arrow keys either
menu buttons to navigate in a virtual scene.
Arrow keys on your keyboard allow 6 spatial degrees of freedom:
	- key_up to go straight on
	- key_down to move back
	- key_right to turn on your right
	- key_left to turn on your left
	- key_pageup to look up
	- key_pagedown to look down
plus
	- key_home to look forward
	- key_end to accelerate
	- key_insert to rise up
	- key_delete to land on the ground

To identify objects, click on the left or right button of the mouse, the name
of the pointed object will appear, maybe with a pushdown menu containing buttons
to activate an action on this object (for example open/close for a door).
